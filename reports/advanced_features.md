Statistics like min max value per categories.

## Build features on categorical variables

1. How many pages user visited
2. Standard deviation of prices
3. Most visited page
4. Many, many more

## If no categorical variables, using Neighbors

1. The number of houses in 500m, 1000m
2. Average price per square meter in 500m, 1000m
3. Number of schools/supermarkets/parking lots in 500m, 1000m
4. distance to closest subway station

1. Mean target of nearest 5,10,15,500,2000
2. Mean distance to 10 closest neighbors
3. Mean distance to 10 closest neighbors with target 1
4. Mean distance to 10 closest neighbors with target 0

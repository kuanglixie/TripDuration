```{r}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
train_dt = fread("../data/raw/train.csv")
test_dt = fread("../data/raw/test.csv")
```

```{r}
nrow(train_dt)
nrow(test_dt)
```

Subsampling to get a subset for analysis.

```{r}
fwrite(train_dt %>% sample_frac(0.1), file = "../data/train_sub.csv")
```
